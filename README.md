Temporary reporitory to display the most interesting scripts I developped for the video game I'm currently working on at the Campus ADN. The game is named Blank anbd it's a story driven third person shooter. The production time is fifteen weeks and the team count about 30 members.

The Blank folder contains all the scripts I made for the game and the Tool folder contains pieces I'm working on integrating to the game in futur updates. The tool folder might also contains scripts references that I will used later on and modify to my need or reverse ingeneer.
